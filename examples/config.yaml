# The static host map defines a set of hosts with with fixed IP addresses on the internet (or any network).
# A host can have multiple fixed IP addresses defined here, and nebula will try each when establishing a tunnel.
# The syntax is:
#   "{nebula ip}": ["{routable ip/dns name}:{routable port}"]
# Example, if your lighthouse has the nebula IP of 192.168.100.1 and has the real ip address of 100.64.22.11 and runs on port 4242:
static_host_map:

  # The firewall is default deny. There is no way to write a deny rule.
  # Rules are comprised of a protocol, port, and one or more of host, group, or CIDR
  # Logical evaluation is roughly: port AND proto AND ca_sha AND ca_name AND (host OR group OR groups OR cidr)
  # - port: Takes `0` or `any` as any, a single number `80`, a range `200-901`, or `fragment` to match second and further fragments of fragmented packets (since there is no port available).
  #   code: same as port but makes more sense when talking about ICMP, TODO: this is not currently implemented in a way that works, use `any`
  #   proto: `any`, `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`
  #   host: `any` or a literal hostname, ie `test-host`
  #   group: `any` or a literal group name, ie `default-group`
  #   groups: Same as group but accepts a list of values. Multiple values are AND'd together and a certificate would have to contain all groups to pass
  #   cidr: a CIDR, `0.0.0.0/0` is any.
  #   ca_name: An issuing CA name
  #   ca_sha: An issuing CA shasum
