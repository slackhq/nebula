# This is the nebula example configuration file. You must edit, at a minimum, the static_host_map, lighthouse, and firewall sections
# Some options in this file are HUPable, including the pki section. (A HUP will reload credentials from disk without affecting existing tunnels)

# PKI defines the location of credentials for this node. Each of these can also be inlined by using the yaml ": |" syntax.
pki:
  # The CAs that are accepted by this node. Must contain one or more certificates created by 'nebula-cert ca'
  ca: /etc/nebula/ca.crt
  cert: /etc/nebula/host.crt
  key: /etc/nebula/host.key

  # disconnect_invalid is a toggle to force a client to be disconnected if the certificate is expired or invalid.
  #disconnect_invalid: true

# The static host map defines a set of hosts with fixed IP addresses on the internet (or any network).
# A host can have multiple fixed IP addresses defined here, and nebula will try each when establishing a tunnel.
# The syntax is:
#   "{nebula ip}": ["{routable ip/dns name}:{routable port}"]
# Example, if your lighthouse has the nebula IP of 192.168.100.1 and has the real ip address of 100.64.22.11 and runs on port 4242:
static_host_map:
  "192.168.100.1": ["100.64.22.11:4242"]

# The static_map config stanza can be used to configure how the static_host_map behaves.
#static_map:
  # cadence determines how frequently DNS is re-queried for updated IP addresses when a static_host_map entry contains
  # a DNS name.
  #cadence: 30s

  # network determines the type of IP addresses to ask the DNS server for. The default is "ip4" because nodes typically
  # do not know their public IPv4 address. Connecting to the Lighthouse via IPv4 allows the Lighthouse to detect the
  # public address. Other valid options are "ip6" and "ip" (returns both.)
  #network: ip4

  # lookup_timeout is the DNS query timeout.
  #lookup_timeout: 250ms

lighthouse:
  # am_lighthouse is used to enable lighthouse functionality for a node. This should ONLY be true on nodes
  # you have configured to be lighthouses in your network
  am_lighthouse: false
  # serve_dns optionally starts a dns listener that responds to various queries and can even be
  # delegated to for resolution
  #serve_dns: false
  #dns:
    # The DNS host defines the IP to bind the dns listener to. This also allows binding to the nebula node IP.
    #host: 0.0.0.0

  # interval is the number of seconds between updates from this node to a lighthouse.
  # during updates, a node sends information about its current IP addresses to each node.
  interval: 60
  # hosts is a list of lighthouse hosts this node should report to and query from
  # IMPORTANT: THIS SHOULD BE EMPTY ON LIGHTHOUSE NODES

  hosts:
    - "192.168.100.1"

  # remote_allow_list allows you to control ip ranges that this node will
  # consider when handshaking to another node. By default, any remote IPs are
  # allowed. You can provide CIDRs here with `true` to allow and `false` to
  # deny. The most specific CIDR rule applies to each remote. If all rules are
  # "allow", the default will be "deny", and vice-versa. If both "allow" and
  # "deny" IPv4 rules are present, then you MUST set a rule for "0.0.0.0/0" as
  # the default. Similarly if both "allow" and "deny" IPv6 rules are present,
  # then you MUST set a rule for "::/0" as the default.
  #remote_allow_list:
    # Example to block IPs from this subnet from being used for remote IPs.
    #"172.16.0.0/12": false

    # A more complicated example, allow public IPs but only private IPs from a specific subnet
    #"0.0.0.0/0": true
    #"10.0.0.0/8": false
    #"10.42.42.0/24": true

  # EXPERIMENTAL: This option may change or disappear in the future.
  # Optionally allows the definition of remote_allow_list blocks
  # specific to an inside VPN IP CIDR.
  #remote_allow_ranges:
    # This rule would only allow only private IPs for this VPN range
    #"10.42.42.0/24":
      #"192.168.0.0/16": true

  # local_allow_list allows you to filter which local IP addresses we advertise
  # to the lighthouses. This uses the same logic as `remote_allow_list`, but
  # additionally, you can specify an `interfaces` map of regular expressions
  # to match against interface names. The regexp must match the entire name.
  # All interface rules must be either true or false (and the default will be
  # the inverse). CIDR rules are matched after interface name rules.
  # Default is all local IP addresses.
  #local_allow_list:
    # Example to block tun0 and all docker interfaces.
    #interfaces:
      #tun0: false
      #'docker.*': false
    # Example to only advertise this subnet to the lighthouse.
    #"10.0.0.0/8": true

  # advertise_addrs are routable addresses that will be included along with discovered addresses to report to the
  # lighthouse, the format is "ip:port". `port` can be `0`, in which case the actual listening port will be used in its
  # place, useful if `listen.port` is set to 0.
  # This option is mainly useful when there are static ip addresses the host can be reached at that nebula can not
  # typically discover on its own. Examples being port forwarding or multiple paths to the internet.
  #advertise_addrs:
    #- "1.1.1.1:4242"
    #- "1.2.3.4:0" # port will be replaced with the real listening port

  # EXPERIMENTAL: This option may change or disappear in the future.
  # This setting allows us to "guess" what the remote might be for a host
  # while we wait for the lighthouse response.
  #calculated_remotes:
    # For any Nebula IPs in 10.0.10.0/24, this will apply the mask and add
    # the calculated IP as an initial remote (while we wait for the response
    # from the lighthouse). Both CIDRs must have the same mask size.
    # For example, Nebula IP 10.0.10.123 will have a calculated remote of
    # 192.168.1.123
    #10.0.10.0/24:
      #- mask: 192.168.1.0/24
      #  port: 4242

# Port Nebula will be listening on. The default here is 4242. For a lighthouse node, the port should be defined,
# however using port 0 will dynamically assign a port and is recommended for roaming nodes.

  # By default, Nebula replies to packets it has no tunnel for with a "recv_error" packet. This packet helps speed up reconnection
